        Adjust the influence of an agent to make it stubborn, maintaining high self-influence and low influence from others.

        Parameters:
        - iteration (int): The current iteration number of the simulation.
        - current_influence (float): The current influence of another agent on the agent.
        - own_index (int): The index of the agent whose influence is being adjusted.
        - other_agent_index (int): The index of the other agent whose influence is being considered.
        - args: Positional arguments (not used here).
        - kwargs: Keyword arguments containing 'alpha'.
            - alpha (float) is the adjustment rate (controls how quickly the influence approaches the stubborn values).
        
        When own_index == other_agent_index, the target influence is 1.0 (self-influence). If the current_influence is already 1.0, it decreases slightly to allow the asymptotic approach to happen.
        When own_index != other_agent_index, the target influence is 0.0 (influence from others). If the current_influence is already 0.0, it increases slightly to allow the asymptotic approach to happen.
